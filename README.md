# LoginRegistrationMern

This is a simple application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) that provides user login and registration functionality. The application consists of both frontend and backend components, and is designed to be a basic starting point for building more complex applications that require user authentication.

## Features
The application includes the following features:

- User registration: Users can create a new account by providing their email address and password. The password is hashed and stored securely in the database.

- User login: Users can log in to their account using their email address and password.

- User authentication: The application uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) to authenticate users and prevent unauthorized access to protected routes.

- Input validation: The frontend includes form validation to ensure that users enter valid data when registering or logging in.

- Home page: Once a user is logged in, the application displays a simple home page with a welcome message.

## Installation and Usage
To install and use this application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/arjuncspkd99/LoginRegisrationMern.git`

2. Install dependencies: `npm install`

3. Start the backend server: `npm run server`

4. Start the frontend development server: `npm run client`

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.
